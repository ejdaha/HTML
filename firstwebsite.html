  <h2 style="font-size:16px; text-align:center;" class="strong">Here is brief information about Nicole Tesla</h2>
<p id="timeline" style="font-family:Serif;">
  <ul>
    <li>Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs, and made early <b>(1893)</b> pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices</li>
    <li>In <b>1870</b>, Tesla moved to Karlovac, to attend school at the Higher Real Gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher Martin Sekuli. The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.</li>
    <li>In <b>1874</b>, Tesla evaded being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away to Tomingaj, near Graƒçac. There, he explored the mountains in hunter's garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj, and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.</li>
